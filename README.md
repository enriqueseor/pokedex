# Pokedex API Project

This project is a fork of Ricardo's Pokedex API project (https://github.com/ricardobar96/pokedex-api-old), and it's designed to consume a Pokemon API and display the data in a RecyclerView.
The app is built using [Android](https://www.android.com/) and is a great example of a casual app for mobile devices.
